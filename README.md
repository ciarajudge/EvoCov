# EvoCov
This is EvoCov, a pipeline designed for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. The pipeline can be run interactively or by default, with a view to using SARS-CoV-2 sequence information to make an evolutionarily aware estimate of efficient epitopes on the spike protein for antibody design.

## Installation
Clone the github repository to your machine to use the EvoCov package. Before using, you should check that any python dependencies are installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciarajudge/EvoCov.git
